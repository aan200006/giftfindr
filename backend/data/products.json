    "title": "Antique French Paste Gilded Bar Brooch | Late 1800s Early 1900s Engraved Pin | Something Old Wedding Jewelry | Bridal Gift Idea",
    "description": "Delicate antique French gilded engraved bar brooch with three prong set very shiny paste stones. This simple and elegant brooch is from the late 19th century or early 20th century. \nThe closure is a typical C clasp. \nIt is in good vintage condition considering its age. The pin at the back is slightly bent as it was often used to gather thick fabric. \nA wonderful &quot;something old&quot; gift for a wedding or a great addition to any antique collection. \n\nDimensions: length 2 3/4&quot;  width 1/8&quot;\n\nWhat is Paste? Paste is a special type of cut glass which emulates a variety of gemstones. In antique jewelry, lead glass was most used, since the denser the material, the higher the refractive index and the greater the dispersion.  \nPaste jewelry dates to France during the 18th century when a jeweler named Georges Frederic Strass began hand crafting fine-quality Paste jewelry in 1724. He was quickly then appointed as \u201cJeweler to the King\u201d and began making Paste jewelry for King Louis XV of France.  \nThe popularity of Paste jewelry quickly rocketed, with the appeal being that it was almost impossible to tell the difference between Paste and the real thing. In fact, in most cases Paste looked and sparkled better!  \nPaste jewels were also often more labor intensive to craft than Gemstone jewelry, as the Paste glass had to be expertly cut and polished by hand. This made the appeal even greater with many in Parisian high society deeming Paste jewelry superior to the real thing!\n\nBy purchasing this item, you are contributing to a more sustainable fashion future. All jewelry comes gift packaged in organza bags or gift boxes.  Please note that most of the jewelry photos are taken at 5 to 10X magnification. This shows any blemishes much more magnified than they really are. Please check dimensions as items might look bigger in pictures.\n\nI make every effort to give a fair description of each vintage or antique item in my store. All items are pre-owned or designed including a pre-owned element. Please keep in mind that most vintage or antique merchandise may have some degree of visible wear or patina. It is normal and considered part of the overall appeal and charm. If you have any questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me. The posted pictures are part of the description, and I am happy to send additional photographs by request. \nYour purchase will be packaged with care and will include tracking. Shipping via USPS Advantage Mail for most items. \nYour satisfaction is my highest priority - please contact me to resolve any problems before you leave feedback.",

Best used in sheltered areas such as covered porches or entryways.\n\n*MAT DARKENS WHEN WET* Avoid wetting only part of the mat to prevent uneven appearance. Do not place live potted plants next to the mat, as water can soak into it unevenly.\n-Drying Tips: If the mat becomes saturated, allow it to dry completely before stepping on it again.\n-Occasional Clay Pieces: You may find small clay pieces in the mat, which is normal and part of the manufacturing process.\n-If you notice a ring around your doormat staining the concrete, it&#39;s not caused by the mat itself but by water and dirt buildup. To prevent this, we recommend purchasing a layering rug to place under your doormat.\n\n*SHIPPING ADIVCE* When your package arrives, open it outside. Some flock fibers may come loose during transit. Carefully remove the mat and shake it gently (avoid vigorous shaking) as the mat is heavy and could tear if mishandled.\n\nRUSH SHIPPING & OVERNIGHT OPTIONS:\nWe offer rush shipping! Select the option that best suits your needs and include the date you need it by in the note section at checkout. Tracking numbers are provided for all shipments.\n\nNOTE FOR INTERNATIONAL BUYERS:\nInternational orders may be subject to additional shipping costs or customs fees. Please provide a phone number at checkout to ensure smooth delivery.
