This striking design is black over white (white will actually be more of a natural color after weaving, like cream.)  \n\nThis would make a perfect Father&#39;s Day gift or any occasion for a man. It&#39;s stately, yet playful, pattern makes a big statement either hanging on a wall or draped over his favorite chair.\n\nWoven Not Printed!\nThese beautiful any-season blankets are artfully woven in the U.S.A. with miles of dyed 100% cotton threads; when combined together make the design within the fabric, not on top like printing, resulting in beautiful texture, depth and huggable softness. \n\nIMPORTANT: Please Note...Since they are made using woven threads to actually create the design, the colors are more rich, warm and earthy. They may differ some from the photos provided. Please reference the Color Difference Chart in the photos before purchasing. Example: The lightest threads feature the natural off-white or beige hue of unbleached muslin, rather than a stark, bright white. (See our ABOUT Page for more information about the blankets)\n\nSize: 50&quot; x 60&quot;\n\nMaterial: 100% Cotton - A perfect weight for all year enjoyment\n\nWashable: Machine Wash in cold water and tumble dry on low.\n\nThis is a MADE-TO-Order item.
